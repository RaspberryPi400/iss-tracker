# ISS Tracker
This is a ISS Tracker! It uses an API (Open Notify) to fetch the current longitude and latitude of the ISS (International Space Station).

# Dependencies
ISS Tracker's Python code needs the 'requests' and 'reverse_geocoder' libraries to run. You can install them by running 'pip install requests/reverse_geocoder' in your terminal. Then, run the code! Or, just go to the GitHub Pages site! The link is in the repo.
